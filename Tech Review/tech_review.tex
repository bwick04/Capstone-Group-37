\begin{abstract}
While we could consider whether we would use a singular camera or multiple, there is really no debate here.
Stereoscopic cameras carry such an advantage for a project like this, we are making that decision.

\section{Live Data Feed} %Alex

Both images simultaneously
Both images plus depth information
Singular image with depth

\section{Live Compression} %Dylan

No compression
Camera live compresses
Computer live compresses

\section{Long-Term Storage}%Alex

1 feed+data, 
2 feeds no data to be re-calculated, 
1 feed data baked into video

\section{CV Software Package} %Ben

OpenCV
vlfeat
vxl

\section{CV Underlying Algorithm} %Ben

Harr cascades

\section{Synchronization} %Alex

two cameras, each sends images and computer works to compensate for any desyncronization
two cameras with global shutter, send back 2 images
2 cameras which do image splicing and send back spliced image to computer

\section{UI Overlay} %Dylan

Open Broadcaster Software
VideoMeld
Camtasia

Goals for the selected software are to show the video stream as it is given, as well as placing boses around objects points sent from the backend's recognition software.

Criteria for each of these softwares include performance overhead and the ability to add more overlay components in real time.

\begin{tabular}{ l l }
  OBS Studio & OBS is a fairly common overlay software.  It has a stable level of performance and is able to pop in elements for the overlay at any time.  It is undetermined as of yet if this software would be able to make these additional elements go to dynamic positions on screen. \\ \hline
  VideoMeld & This seems to be from before the era of livestreams, and though it has a wide variety for overlay objects, I cannot find any way for it to support dynamically occuring objects in the overlay  \\ \hline
  Camtasia & This only works live through an extra plugin and it has significant overhead in the process.  Dynamic overlay objects do not seem to be supported. \\
\end{tabular}

Discussion

I choose OBS based on what is discussed above.
