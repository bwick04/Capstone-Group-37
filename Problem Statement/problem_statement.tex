\begin{abstract}
Using a camera mounted on a car, we are attempting to determine the speeds of other nearby vehicles.  This will be done by having the camera recognize nearby vehicles and determining their speeds relative to our own vehicle. To make this work, we will have to research the Kinect and how it processes images, aw well as how we can determine what in the field of view is a vehicle, and how fast it is moving relative to us.
