# Capstone-Group-37

This repository is for a senior design project at Oregon State University. It includes required documents as well as the main code, which can be found in the videoRadar folder.

This project is intended to be a proof of concept. Our project is an alternative method for speed tracking. Our implementation is only capable of tracking red circlular objects using the EmguCV library. This is done by creating a range of HSV values to track. Our speed tracking also relies on the Xbox 360 Kinect, as we utilize the infrared signals to create a depth map to determine the distance of our object. Unfortunately. because the Kinect relies on infrared signals, this means our system is not capable of being used outside.

This project has shown how many real world applications for this kind of system. Such applications include tracking vehichle speeds on a freeway, tracking sport objects or athletes, analyzing the movement of crowds, and a lot more!

Special thanks to our project sponsor Alex Neighbors!
